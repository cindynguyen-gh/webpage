            <p>Starry, starry night
              Paint your palette blue and grey
              Look out on a summer's day
              With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
              Shadows on the hills
              Sketch the trees and the daffodils
              Catch the breeze and the winter chills
              In colors on the snowy linen land
            </p>
            <p>Now I understand
              What you tried to say to me
              And how you suffered for your sanity
              And how you tried to set them free
              They would not listen, they did not know how
              Perhaps they'll listen now</p>

            <p>Starry, starry night
              Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
              Swirling clouds in violet haze
              Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
              Colors changing hue
              Morning fields of amber grain
              Weathered faces lined in pain
              Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
            </p>
            <p>Now I understand
              What you tried to say to me
              And how you suffered for your sanity
              And how you tried to set them free
              They would not listen, they did not know how
              Perhaps they'll listen now

          <div class="col-sm">
            <P>For they could not love you
              But still your love was true
              And when no hope was left in sight
              On that starry, starry night
              You took your life, as lovers often do
              But I could have told you, Vincent
              This world was never meant for one
              As beautiful as you
            </P>
            <p>Starry, starry night
              Portraits hung in empty halls
              Frameless heads on nameless walls
              With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
              Like the strangers that you've met
              The ragged men in the ragged clothes
              The silver thorn, a bloody rose
              Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow</p>
